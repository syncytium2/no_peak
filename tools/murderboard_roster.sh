# murderboard_roster.sh — derive the review-team roster FROM the process file, and check
# that a review report actually accounts for every role.
#
# THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `doc_review_process.md` says "every role runs on every deliverable"
# and "a role with genuinely nothing to check returns 'no findings, and here is what I
# checked'". Both are prose addressed to the reviewer. Nothing reads the finished report
# and asks whether all of them are actually in it — so a run that fired 7 of 11 roles and a
# run that fired all 11 cleanly produce reports that are indistinguishable to the reader.
#
# That is the same defect the process itself names as a rule ("can the alarm ring?"): a
# claim of absence resting on an instrument that could not have registered the presence.
# "No findings from role 9" is worthless if role 9 was never spawned.
#
# Two jobs, both cheap:
#   list   — parse the roles out of the process file. The roster is DERIVED, never recalled,
#            so adding role 12 upstream propagates to every consumer's check for free.
#   check  — verify a review report names every role in the roster. Exit 1 if any is missing.
#
# USAGE
#   murderboard_roster.sh list                  print "N<TAB>title" for each role
#   murderboard_roster.sh count                 print how many roles the process defines
#   murderboard_roster.sh check REPORT.md       every role accounted for? (0 yes / 1 no)
#   murderboard_roster.sh --process PATH ...    use this process file (default: autodetect)
#   murderboard_roster.sh --selftest            prove every branch can still fire
#
# EXIT CODES   0 = ok   1 = roles missing from the report   2 = could not determine
#
# Project-neutral: no hardcoded consumer paths.
