# murderboard_freshness.sh — is this repo's VENDORED murderboard current with upstream?
#
# THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `doc_review_process.md` step 0 tells a reviewer to confirm the
# process is current before running it. That is prose: it fires only if someone
# remembers, and the one time nobody did, a deck shipped a slide-overlap defect using a
# copy that predated the slide-overlap rule. The rule existed. The copy was old. Nothing
# said so.
#
# The same failure has now happened at a larger scale: a consumer's `main` sat 10 commits
# and 11 days behind while ~17 worktrees branched from it and inherited the stale copy,
# because re-vendoring kept happening on leaf branches and never flowed back.
#
# So this is the mechanized version of step 0: it compares the vendored stamp against
# upstream HEAD and says so, by itself, at every session start. SILENT when current —
# a check that speaks every time gets tuned out, and then it is just prose again.
#
# USAGE
#   murderboard_freshness.sh                 check; silent if current, report if stale
#   murderboard_freshness.sh --verbose       always print the verdict
#   murderboard_freshness.sh --file PATH     check this vendored file (default: autodetect).
#                                            Repeatable; naming files also SCOPES the
#                                            cross-stamp check to just those files.
#   murderboard_freshness.sh --label NAME    what is being checked (default: murderboard).
#                                            Appears in every message.
#   murderboard_freshness.sh --slug O/R      upstream repo (default: syncytium2/murderboard)
#   murderboard_freshness.sh --clone PATH    where a local clone of that upstream lives
#   murderboard_freshness.sh --upstream SHA  skip upstream lookup (testing / offline)
#   murderboard_freshness.sh --refresh       ignore the cache, re-resolve upstream now
#   murderboard_freshness.sh --hook          never touch the network; serve the cache and
#                                            refresh it detached (for SessionStart hooks)
#   murderboard_freshness.sh --selftest      prove every branch can still fire
#
# EXIT CODES   0 = current   1 = STALE   2 = could not determine (never a false "current")
#
# UPSTREAM RESOLUTION, in order. The first that answers wins; each is capped:
#   1. --upstream SHA                       explicit
#   2. $MURDERBOARD_HEAD                    explicit, via environment
#   3. gh api (the authority — asks the remote)
#   4. a local clone's origin/main          offline fallback; may itself be behind, so
#                                           the verdict is labelled with its source
#
# CACHE. Upstream HEAD is cached for $TTL seconds in the git common dir (machine-local,
# shared by every worktree, never committed), because this runs in a SessionStart hook
# that blocks session startup and cannot afford a network call every time.
#
# NOT MURDERBOARD-ONLY ANY MORE. The failure it catches — a vendored copy drifting with
# nothing to announce it — is not specific to this repo, and it bit in the other direction
# too: three consumers ran interface2's PRE-FIX SessionStart hook for weeks, including the
# commit written expressly so they would not inherit that outage. One gate, pointed at a
# family with --label/--slug/--clone/--file, serves every vendoring relationship.
